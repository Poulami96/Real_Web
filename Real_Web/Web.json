The site, a rail yard, has been rezoned for commercial and residential development and will house what is essentially a neighborhood built from scratch. The project is an alternative to another, failed redevelopment idea that was based on New York City hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics and the construction of a sports stadium. The Related Companies and Oxford Property Group are the developers charged with building the core of the current site: millions of square feet of commercial and residential space, including 5,000 apartments, a hotel, a public school, and approximately 12 acres of public open space on the 26-acre site. The neighborhood is served by the 11th Avenue subway station of the 7 line, which opened in 2015. -TA",

Kushner split the retail space into two condominiums, selling the smaller, 36,473-square-foot space to Inditex, parent company of fashion brand Zara, for $324 million or $8,300 per square foot on a blended basis, the highest price ever paid for commercial property larger than 10,000 square feet in New York City. Vornado bought a controlling 49.5 percent interest in the office condominium for $80 million in December 2011, and took the remaining 40,742-square-foot retail condo for $707 million in July 2012.\nThe 39-story 1957 building, designed by Carson & Lundin, stretches from 52nd Street to 53rd Street and includes landmarked lobby artwork: Isamu Noguchi's \"Ceiling and Waterfall\" installation.",

A duplex penthouse at 1060 Fifth Avenue sold for $48.8 million in 2008. In 2006, the Harkness Mansion, a townhouse at 4 East 75th Street, traded for $53 million. Museums along Fifth Avenue include the Frick Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Yorkville subsection of the neighborhood, north of 79th street and east of Third Avenue contains much cheaper housing. Its rental buildings attract recent college graduates. The official resident of the mayor, Gracie Mansion, is also located in Yorkville, in Carl Schurz Park at East End Avenue and 88th Street. Other subsections of the Upper East Side are Lenox Hill and Carnegie Hill. Thanks to its stock of former mansions and relative proximity to the United Nations, the neighborhood is home to many diplomatic missions, including the consulates of France at 934 Fifth Avenue and Italy at 690 Park Avenue.

The 2.9 million-square-foot building occupies a full city block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 15th and 16th Streets. Architecture firm Lusby Simpson of Abbott, Merkt & Co. designed the building for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which completed it in 1932. 111 Eighth Avenue initially operated as a freight and storage hub. When railroad operations dwindled in Manhattan at the turn of the century, it became the headquarters of the Port Authority until the government agency moved to the first World Trade Center complex in 1970. Taconic Investment Partners acquired it in 1998 as part of a portfolio of assets that also included 95 and 99 Wall Street and 100 William Street. At the time, warehouse tenants occupied much of the property and Midtown South was not considered a white-collar business district. The buildings printing and warehouse tenants moved out and Taconic repositioned it as office space geared to media and technology companies. In 2010, Google, one of the buildings tenants, acquired 111 Eighth Avenue for $1.77 billion from Taconic. The real estate investment firm continued to manage the property on Googles behalf, as of September 2015. -GB & TA",

Related Chief Executive Stephen M. Ross said in 2004 that his company planned to extend the buildings Section 8 contract, which runs to 2017. Building amenities include a playground, five tennis courts, and gym, a swimming pool, and a 1,000-car garage.

    "description": "Bushwick is a neighborhood in northern Brooklyn, bounded by Flushing Avenue, Broadway, the borough of Queens and the Cemetery of the Evergreens. Some real estate market participants call it East Williamsburg and sometimes include the industrial area north of Flushing Avenue in the neighborhood, calling it Industrial Bushwick. Knickerbocker Avenue is Bushwick's main shopping street. The neighborhood owes its rising property prices to the proximity of Williamsburg to the west and the fact that the popular L subway line runs through it and into downtown Manhattan (though service to Manhattan will stop for 18 months starting in early 2019 to repair tunnel damage from Superstorm Sandy). Housing stock consists mostly of two- to three-family row houses and midsize apartment buildings. Hundreds of units in the neighborhood are government-subsidized. As in Williamsburg in the 1990s, Bushwick's warehouses have been repurposed as artists' studios or as sites for large parties. Manhattan and Williamsburg transplants, in search of cheaper housing and more space, have been pushing out Bushwick's immigrant and Latino population. As of 2015, Dallas-based developer Lincoln Property Company was converting a 100,000-square-foot factory at 455 Jefferson Street into an office building with retail space. Bushwick Realty Holdings LLC, controlled by Brooklyn landlord Moshe Braver, plans to build a 180-unit residential apartment building at 338 Evergreen Avenue. Other residential developments include 330 Bleecker Street, 13 Melrose Street, Colony 1209 at 1209 DeKalb Avenue, 51 Troutman Street and 95 Evergreen.",

JDS Development converted The Walker Tower, an old Verizon building at 210 West 18th Street into upscale condominiums. In 2010, internet search giant Google acquired a warehouse-to-tech office conversion at 111 Eighth Avenue that was at one time owned by The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The rent-stabilized residents of The Chelsea Hotel on 23rd Street have so far resisted the efforts of a series of developers hoping to conduct a condo-conversion at the cultural landmark. -TA",

    "description": "Staten Island, with its population of 473,279, is the least populous and most suburban of New York City\u00cds five boroughs. The 1964 opening of the Verrazano Bridge, which connected the borough to Brooklyn, drove development of the previously rural area and doubled its population. Its northern edge is dotted with denser, more urban neighborhoods like St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton, which are close the terminal for the ferry to Lower Manhattan. The southern end of the island is more leafy. One could mistake its streets, lined with large single-family homes, with yards and pools, for a bedroom community in upstate New York. Staten Island is not connected to the rest of New York City Subway system, except by the ferry, unlike the other four boroughs. The rapid rise of real estate prices has not bypassed Staten Island, which has seen its share of development as a result. In 2011, the city sold seven waterfront acres in the Stapleton neighborhood for $11 million to Ironstate Development. A 900-unit rental complex, plus retail and parking, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2015. The city is also leading the redevelopment of the waterfront around the ferry terminal and the Richmond County Ballpark. In order to attract tourists to the borough, developers are planning to build the biggest Ferris wheel in the world in St. George. -TA",

Located in the hoighty-toighty Lenox Hill neighborhood of New York City, and unfortunately built in in 1929 on the cusp of the Great Depression, the building has changed hands (and names) several times. For years it had been home to a number of hotels: first the Viceroy, then the Cromwell Arms, and finally Hotel Delmonico, where it was home to several celebrities, including Ed Sullivan, and the alleged location of where Bob Dylan introduced marijuana to the Beatles.\nIn 2001 Trump bought the building for $115 million and within a couple years converted it from a hotel into a 120-unit luxury residential condominium, though with the intention of keeping some hotel-esque features like maid and laundry service. The building still has touches of pre-war, including hand-laid brick, but Trump has pumped nearly $100 million into renovating it.\nToday the property continues to hue to its star-hugging past. A number of high-profile renters have lived there, including the owner of the New York Giants, infamous baseball player Alex Rodriguez, and Rupert Murdoch.\n-NR",
